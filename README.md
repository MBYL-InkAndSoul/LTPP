# Legacy-Translations-Patcher-Pack
## Introduction
No more stuff, just a resource pack to fix or improve the translations of mods that are already no longer supported.

## Support
Mainly fix Chinese translation now (provide by Ink&amp;Soul). But you can also upload the translation of other language if you make sure quality (But encouragement to try), copyright and ingenuity.

**This means that you cannot copy the translations from another existing project, unless you owned it. **

**Only one exception: it is based on official translation and follow licence.**
