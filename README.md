# Legacy-Translations-Patcher-Pack
## Introduction
No more stuff, just a resource pack to fix or improve the translations of mods that are already no longer supported.

## Support
Mainly fix Chinese translation now (provide by Ink&amp;Soul). But you can also upload the translation of other language if you make sure quality, ingenuity and copyright.

This means that you can't copy the translation from another existing project, unless you owned it.

If you are finding Simplified-Chinese translation, see also: [CFPA](https://github.com/CFPAOrg/Minecraft-Mod-Language-Package).

## Support Mod list
